# RGB Pmod
 ## Introducion
 In this repo you can find the design files and a code example for the rgb matrix pmod I designed. It is based on a 1x1mm RGB led and the GN1640 LED driver.

 The leds used are: https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Light-Emitting-Diodes-LED_Foshan-NationStar-Optoelectronics-FC-B1010RGBT-HG_C158099.html

And the driver is: https://lcsc.com/product-detail/LED-Drivers_GN-GN1640_C265478.html

Note that the TM1640 is pin compatible and an english datasheet can be found for that chip.

When replicating this project it is highly recommended to order a stencil and use solder paste to solder the LEDs

## Usage and Support
Feel free to use the design and code in this repo for your own project. Please credit this repo, or @mifune on twitter if you do.

This is a hobby project that I shared because there has been some interest in it. I will not offer it for sale (though I won't stop you from doing so). Please let me know if there is a file missing in the repo, other than that I won't offer support. I'm already working on the next project.
